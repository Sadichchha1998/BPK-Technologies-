Since the job requires excellent database knowledge and algorithm skill, please complete the following task.
â€¢ For a school, I would like to store the marks for all the students of grade 1 to 8 for all the subjects they study.
o Design a table structure to store the student marks in all subjects
o Design a screen to add new student details (f.name, l.name, dob, parent's name, address, city, phone#) and show the list of students with these data in a table as and when it is created.
o Generate a report that will show all the students who have scored more than 60%

Students Table:
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    DOB DATE,
    ParentName VARCHAR(100),
    Address VARCHAR(255),
    City VARCHAR(50),
    PhoneNumber VARCHAR(15)
);

Subjects Table:
CREATE TABLE Subjects (
    SubjectID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    SubjectName VARCHAR(50)
);

StudentMarks Table:
CREATE TABLE StudentMarks (
    RecordID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentID INT,
    SubjectID INT,
    Marks INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID),
    FOREIGN KEY (SubjectID) REFERENCES Subjects(SubjectID)
);

Now, when you want to add new student details, you would insert data into the Students table. To add marks for each student in a subject, you would insert data into the StudentMarks table.

For the reporting requirement:

SELECT Students.StudentID, Students.FirstName, Students.LastName
FROM Students
JOIN StudentMarks ON Students.StudentID = StudentMarks.StudentID
JOIN Subjects ON StudentMarks.SubjectID = Subjects.SubjectID
GROUP BY Students.StudentID, Students.FirstName, Students.LastName
HAVING AVG(Marks) > 60;

This query retrieves the students who have an average mark greater than 60% across all subjects.
